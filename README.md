# GildedRoseRefactor

This repository is our team's engagement with a refactoring kata, called [GildedRose](https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose#gilded-rose-refactoring-kata). It is assembled to satisfy a mob programming assignment from [CSCI E-71](http://agilesoftwareclass.org/), a Harvard Extension School course.


## Objective 1

_Mob with your teammates to add unit tests until it is safe to refactor the legacy code. To demonstrate that you worked as a mob, capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo. Here's an example. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file._

We recorded much of our mob session and uploaded to YouTube, video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1OMnyBpKmI).

## Objective 2

_Identify at least one solution for remote pair- and mob programming. What tools will you use to enable excellent f2f-like collaboration? Strive to reproduce the mobbing we experienced during our on-campus weekend. Document your solution in your repoâ€™s README._

We ultimately settled on the free tier of [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) to collaborate and remotely control the screen. As a group, we also tried several others which did not quite work out on first blush. Specifically, we tried [YouTube Streaming](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026?hl=en) (_issue: only camera_), [Join.Me](https://www.join.me/) (_issue: no recording_), [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) (_issue: no recording_), and [Team Viewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/) (_issue: no recording_). In fairness to most of the other services attempted, we did not linger very long to try to troubleshoot.

Zoom performed very well for us. The free tier allows 40 minutes of recording per session which served our purposes to demonstrate our approximation of the mob programming technique applied during our on-campus weekend. While indirect communication such as body language cannot be as easily interpretted via a remote format, other benefits were realized:

* Driver can see all faces and hear all voices without losing concentration on screen.
* Navigators are encouraged to sequence comments as talk-over in remote format is uncomfortable when listened to in a headset; talk-over in an in-person mob session does not lead to navigators' self-correcting.
* Screensharing allowed our team to all work from one machine, under one repository, without switching seats to change drivers.
